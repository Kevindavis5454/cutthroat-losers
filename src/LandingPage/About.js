                <h1>About Cutthroat Losers</h1>
                <p>Cutthroat losers came about as a light hearted way for a group of friends to tackle a very challenging issue, weightloss.
                Through past experience with other weight loss competitions the atmosphere got far too serious, and we wanted a change. We wanted a way to
                both become healthier humans and let off steam and frustrations in constructive ways. Thus, cutthroat losers was born.

                We hope you enjoy it as much as we have.</p>
